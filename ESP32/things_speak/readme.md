# Installing the ThingSpeak Library
To send sensor readings to ThingSpeak, we’ll use the thingspeak-arduino library. You can install this library through the Arduino Library Manager. Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries… and search for “ThingSpeak” in the Library Manager. Install the ThingSpeak library by MathWorks.
