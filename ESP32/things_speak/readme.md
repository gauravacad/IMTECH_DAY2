# Installing the ThingSpeak Library
To send sensor readings to ThingSpeak, we’ll use the thingspeak-arduino library. You can install this library through the Arduino Library Manager. Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries… and search for “ThingSpeak” in the Library Manager. Install the ThingSpeak library by MathWorks.

# ThingSpeak – Getting Started

Go to [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.mathworks.com/ ) an click the “Get Started For Free” button to create a new account. This account is linked to a Mathworks account. So, if you already have a Mathworks account, you should log in with that account.

3. Type a name for your channel and add a description.
4. In this example, we’ll just publish temperature. If you want to publish multiple readings (like humidity and pressure), you can enable more fields as you’ll see later in this tutorial.
